2. Explain TCP/IP reference model with a neat labeled diagram. 
The TCP/IP reference model is a simpliﬁed, four-layer networking model that guides data exchange across 
networks. Unlike the OSI model, TCP/IP is speciﬁcally designed for internetworking (connecting different 

networks). It provides end-to-end data communication, specifying how data should be packaged, transmitted, 
routed, and received. 
Layers of the TCP/IP Model

4. Explain the importance of framing and Piggybacking techniques? 
Framing 
Deﬁnition: 
Framing is the technique of encapsulating data packets into frames for transmission over a network. Each 
frame contains not only the payload (the actual data) but also control information, such as headers and 
trailers. 
Importance: 
a) Data Integrity: Framing ensures that the data is transmitted without corruption. The control 
information allows for error detection and correction, ensuring the integrity of the transmitted data. 

b) Synchronization: Frames provide a clear boundary between packets of data. This synchronization 
helps the receiving device to identify the beginning and end of each frame, facilitating accurate data 
interpretation. 
c) Efﬁcient Use of Bandwidth: By grouping bits into frames, framing minimizes overhead, enabling 
efﬁcient use of the communication channel. It helps reduce the chances of data loss during 
transmission. 
d) Protocol Differentiation: Different protocols can use different framing methods (like Ethernet, PPP, 
etc.), allowing for protocol-speciﬁc data handling and providing ﬂexibility in communication. 
e) Flow Control and Congestion Management: Frames can contain information that helps in managing 
ﬂow control and congestion, ensuring that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver. 
 
Piggybacking 
Deﬁnition: 
Piggybacking is a technique used in two-way communication where an acknowledgment (ACK) for a received 
frame is sent along with the next data frame. Instead of sending a separate ACK frame, the sender combines 
the acknowledgment with the next outgoing data frame. 
Importance: 
a) Reduced Overhead: By combining an acknowledgment with data transmission, piggybacking 
minimizes the number of frames sent over the network. This reduces the overhead associated 
with separate acknowledgment frames, making data transmission more efﬁcient. 
b) Increased Throughput: Piggybacking allows for higher throughput in the network by optimizing 
the use of bandwidth. It leads to fewer packets being sent, which can enhance the overall 
efﬁciency of the communication process. 
c) Improved Utilization of the Network: It makes better use of the available network capacity by 
allowing data frames and acknowledgments to be sent together. This technique helps in 
preventing the network from being idle while waiting for an acknowledgment. 
d) Better Flow Control: By providing feedback to the sender while simultaneously sending data, 
piggybacking helps maintain a smooth ﬂow of data, preventing congestion and ensuring that the 
sender can adapt to the receiver's processing capabilities. 
e) Latency Reduction: It can signiﬁcantly reduce the latency in communication since the 
acknowledgment does not require a separate round trip. This results in quicker response times in 
interactive applications. 
 
5. Deﬁne computer networks? Explain LAN, WAN, MAN in detail with a neat diagram? 
Types of Computer Network: LAN, MAN and WAN 
A computer network is a group of computers connected with each other through a transmission medium 
such as cable, wire etc.  

 
There are mainly three types of computer networks based on their size: 
1. Local Area Network (LAN) 
2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) 
3. Wide area network (WAN) 
1. Local Area Network (LAN) 
 
1. Local area network is a group of computers connected with each other in a small place such as school, 
hospital, apartment etc. 
2. LAN is secure because there is no outside connection with the local area network thus the data which is 
shared is safe on the local area network and can’t be accessed outside. 
3. LAN due to their small size are considerably faster, their speed can range anywhere from 100 to 100Mbps. 
4. LANs are not limited to wire connection, there is a new evolution to the LANs that allows local area 
network to work on a wireless connection. 
2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) 
 
MAN network covers larger area by connections LANs to a larger network of computers. In Metropolitan area 
network various Local area networks are connected with each other through telephone lines. The size of the 
Metropolitan area network is larger than LANs and smaller than WANs (wide area networks), a MANs covers 
the larger area of a city or town. 
3. Wide area network (WAN) 

 
Wide area network provides long distance transmission of data. The size of the WAN is larger than LAN and 
MAN. A WAN can cover country, continent or even a whole world. Internet connection is an example of WAN. 
Other examples of WAN are mobile broadband connections such as 3G, 4G etc. 
 
 
 
Advantages of WAN: 
Centralized infrastructure: One of the main advantages of WAN is the that we do not need to maintain the 
backup and store data on local system as everything is stored online on a data centre, from where we can 
access the data through WAN. 
Privacy: We can setup the WAN in such a way that it encrypts the data that we share online that way the 
data is secure and minimises the risk of unauthorized access. 
Increased Bandwidth: With the WAN we get to choose the bandwidth based on the need, a large organization 
can have larger bandwidth that can carry large amount of data faster and efﬁciently. 
Area: A WAN can cover a large area or even a whole world though internet connection thus we can connect 
with the person in another country through WAN which is not possible is other type of computer networks. 
Disadvantages of WAN: 
Antivirus: Since our systems are connected with the large amount of systems, there is possibility that we may 
unknowingly download the virus that can affect our system and become threat to our privacy and may lead to 
data loss. 
Expensive: Cost of installation is very high. 
Issue resolution: Issue resolution takes time as the WAN covers large area, it is really difﬁcult to pin point the 
exact location where the issues raised and causing the problem. 
 
6. What is data communication? What are the fundamental characteristics? List and explain ﬁve components 
of data communication with examples? 
Data Communication 
Data communication refers to the exchange of digital data between devices over a communication medium. 
It involves the transmission of data from a sender to a receiver, using a set of protocols that ensure the 
integrity and delivery of that data. Data communication can occur over various media, including wired 
connections (like coaxial cables and ﬁbre optics) and wireless connections (like radio waves and infrared). 
Fundamental Characteristics of Data Communication 

a) Delivery: The data must be delivered accurately and completely to the intended recipient. 
b) Accuracy: The data received must be the same as the data sent, ensuring no errors during transmission. 
c) Timeliness: Data communication should occur within a reasonable time frame, providing timely delivery. 
d) Effectiveness: The communication system must be efﬁcient, utilizing the available bandwidth optimally 
without unnecessary delays. 
e) Security: Measures should be in place to protect data from unauthorized access or tampering during 
transmission. 
Components of Data Communication 
The data communication process involves several key components, each playing a vital role in the 
transmission and reception of data. Here are ﬁve fundamental components: 
a) Message 
o 
Deﬁnition: The actual data or information that is being transmitted. It can be in various 
forms, such as text, audio, video, or any other digital format. 
o 
Example: An email message, a ﬁle transfer (like a PDF document), or a video stream (like 
a YouTube video). 
b) Sender 
o 
Deﬁnition: The device or entity that initiates the data transmission. The sender converts 
the message into a suitable format for transmission. 
o 
Example: A computer, smartphone, or server that sends an email or uploads a ﬁle to the 
internet. 
c) Receiver 
o 
Deﬁnition: The device or entity that receives the transmitted data. The receiver converts 
the received signals back into a format that can be understood. 
o 
Example: A computer, smartphone, or server that receives the email or downloaded ﬁle. 
d) Transmission Medium 
o 
Deﬁnition: The physical path through which the data travels from sender to receiver. It 
can be wired (copper cables, ﬁbre optics) or wireless (radio waves, infrared). 
o 
Example: 
 
Wired: Ethernet cables, ﬁbre optic cables. 
 
Wireless: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks. 
e) Protocol 
o 
Deﬁnition: A set of rules and conventions that determine how data is transmitted over 
the network. Protocols ensure that devices can communicate effectively and understand 
each other. 
o 
Example: 
 
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is used for data 
transmission on the internet. 
 
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used for transferring web pages. 

 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used for transfer 
 
7. Deﬁne Checksum and list the steps involved in both sender and receiver side? 
Checksum 
A checksum is an error-detection mechanism used in data transmission to ensure the integrity of data. It 
involves calculating a numerical value based on the data being transmitted, which is then sent along with the 
data. The receiver can calculate the checksum of the received data and compare it to the transmitted 
checksum to determine if any errors occurred during transmission. 
Steps Involved in Checksum Calculation 
Sender Side 
a) Data Preparation: 
o 
The sender prepares the data to be transmitted. This data could be a ﬁle, a message, or any 
digital information. 
b) Segmentation: 
o 
The data is divided into equal-sized segments or blocks (typically, 16-bit blocks). If the last block 
is smaller than the speciﬁed size, it may be padded with zeros. 
c) Checksum Calculation: 
o 
For each segment of data, the sender performs the following: 
 
Sum all the segments together. 
 
If the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be represented (e.g., 65535 for a 16-bit 
segment), wrap around and add the overﬂow back to the sum. 
 
Take the one's complement of the ﬁnal sum to obtain the checksum. 
d) Sending Data: 
o 
The sender transmits both the original data and the calculated checksum to the receiver. 
o 
 
Receiver Side 
a) Receiving Data: 
o 
The receiver obtains the data and the accompanying checksum from the sender. 
b) Segmentation: 
o 
The receiver divides the received data into the same segment sizes as the sender did. 
c) Checksum Calculation: 
o 
The receiver calculates the checksum of the received data in the same manner as the sender: 
 
Sum all received segments together, handling overﬂow as before. 
 
Take the one's complement of the ﬁnal sum to obtain the receiver's checksum. 
d) Checksum Comparison: 

o 
The receiver adds the calculated checksum to the received checksum. If the result equals the 
maximum value that can be represented (e.g., 65535 for a 16-bit checksum), it indicates that the 
data is likely error-free. If not, it indicates an error in transmission. 
 
8. Brieﬂy Explain static channel and dynamic channel allocation problem. 
In computer networking and telecommunications, channel allocation refers to how communication channels 
are assigned to users or devices to enable data transmission. There are two primary types of channel 
allocation strategies: static and dynamic. Here's a brief explanation of both: 
Static Channel Allocation 
Deﬁnition: In static channel allocation, the communication channels are allocated to users or devices in a 
ﬁxed manner, regardless of their demand for bandwidth. The allocation remains constant for the duration of 
the communication session or for a speciﬁed period. 
Characteristics: 
 
Fixed Assignment: Each user is assigned a speciﬁc channel (or bandwidth) that remains unchanged 
during the communication session. 
 
Simplicity: The implementation of static allocation schemes is relatively straightforward since 
channels are pre-assigned. 
 
Inefﬁciency: This method can lead to inefﬁcient use of resources. If a user does not utilize the 
allocated channel, the channel remains idle and is unavailable for other users. 
 
Examples: Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) where each frequency band is assigned to a 
speciﬁc user or time division multiplexing (TDM) where users are assigned speciﬁc time slots. 
Advantages: 
 
Predictable performance since each user knows the channel available for their use. 
 
Simpliﬁed resource management as the allocation does not change. 
Disadvantages: 
 
Inefﬁcient utilization of channels, especially if the demand ﬂuctuates. 
 
Limited ﬂexibility to accommodate varying trafﬁc loads. 
Dynamic Channel Allocation 
Deﬁnition: In dynamic channel allocation, the communication channels are allocated to users or devices 
based on current demand and availability. Channels can be assigned, released, or reallocated dynamically as 
users connect or disconnect. 
Characteristics: 
 
Flexible Assignment: Users can request and release channels as needed, allowing for more efﬁcient 
use of resources. 
 
Scalability: This method can accommodate varying numbers of users and ﬂuctuating bandwidth 
demands more effectively. 

 
Examples: Code division multiple access (CDMA) where multiple users can share the same frequency 
band using unique codes, and dynamic frequency selection (DFS) that allows access points to select 
available channels based on current usage. 
Advantages: 
 
More efﬁcient use of available channels since they are allocated based on real-time demand. 
 
Better scalability to handle varying trafﬁc loads and user demands. 
Disadvantages: 
 
Increased complexity in managing channel allocation due to the dynamic nature of the assignment. 
 
Potential delays in channel allocation as users may have to wait for available channels. 
 
9. How would you compare between guided media and unguided media with examples. 
Guided Media 
Deﬁnition: Guided media, also known as wired or bounded media, refers to physical transmission paths 
where data signals are transmitted along a speciﬁc, deﬁned route. This type of media relies on physical cables 
or ﬁbres to guide the signals from the sender to the receiver. 
Characteristics: 
 
Physical Connections: Signals are transmitted through physical cables or optical ﬁbres. 
 
Less Interference: Guided media is less susceptible to external interference compared to unguided 
media. 
 
Higher Security: The physical nature of the connections provides better security, as unauthorized 
access is more difﬁcult. 
 
Limited Mobility: Users are typically stationary, as devices must be physically connected to the 
medium. 
Examples: 
 
Twisted Pair Cable: Commonly used in telephone and local area networks (LANs). It consists of pairs 
of insulated copper wires twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference. 
 
Coaxial Cable: Often used for cable television and internet connections, coaxial cable consists of a 
central conductor surrounded by insulation, a metallic shield, and an outer cover. 
 
Fiber Optic Cable: Uses light to transmit data over long distances at high speeds. It consists of thin 
strands of glass or plastic that carry light signals. 
Unguided Media 
Deﬁnition: Unguided media, also known as wireless or unbounded media, refers to transmission methods 
where data signals are sent through the air or space without a deﬁned physical path. Signals are transmitted 
through electromagnetic waves, and they can be received by any device within range. 
Characteristics: 
 
No Physical Connections: Signals are transmitted through the air or space, allowing for greater 
mobility. 

 
Susceptible to Interference: Unguided media can be affected by environmental factors, such as 
obstacles, weather, and other electronic signals, leading to potential data loss or degradation. 
 
Lower Security: Since signals can be received by any device within range, unguided media is more 
vulnerable to unauthorized access and eavesdropping. 
 
Greater Flexibility: Users can connect and communicate from various locations without being 
physically tethered to a network. 
Examples: 
 
Radio Waves: Used for broadcasting audio and video signals, such as FM/AM radio and television. 
 
Microwave Transmission: Often used for point-to-point communication systems, such as satellite 
communication and cellular networks. 
 
Infrared Transmission: Used for short-range communication, such as remote controls and certain 
wireless networking protocols (e.g., IrDA). 
 
10. With a neat diagram, explain describe CRC encoder and decoder C (7,4). 
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is an error-detection technique used in digital networks and storage devices 
to detect accidental changes to raw data. A CRC encoder and decoder ensure that the data sent over a 
network is free from errors by appending a CRC value to the data. Let's describe a CRC encoder and decoder 
for a speciﬁc code, C(7, 4), which means it encodes 4 bits of data into a 7-bit code word. 
Overview of C (7, 4) Code 
In C (7, 4): 
 
7 bits is the total length of the code word (including data and CRC bits). 
 
4 bits is the length of the actual data. 
The remaining bits (7 - 4 = 3 bits) are used for error detection, speciﬁcally the CRC bits. 
1. CRC Encoder: 
 
Message Polynomial: Represent the 4-bit message as a polynomial. 
 
Generator Polynomial: Choose a generator polynomial (usually denoted as G(x)). 
 
Shift Register: Perform the division of the message polynomial by the generator polynomial using a s
hift register. 
 
Codeword: The 7-bit codeword is formed by appending the remainder to the original message. 
2. CRC Decoder: 
 
Received Polynomial: Represent the received 7-bit codeword as a polynomial. 
 
Shift Register: Divide the received polynomial by the same generator polynomial used in encoding. 
 
Error Detection: If the remainder is zero, the message is considered error-
free; otherwise, an error is detected. 

 
11. How would you describe the working of Go-Back-N protocol and how it is different from selective repeat 
ARQ? 
 
Go-Back-N is simpler but can lead to inefﬁciencies due to its requirement to retransmit all frames after a 
lost frame. It is suitable for environments where the network is reliable and has low latency. 
 
Selective Repeat ARQ is more efﬁcient in terms of bandwidth usage as it only retransmits speciﬁc 
frames that are lost or erroneous, allowing for better utilization of the network. However, it requires more 
complex mechanisms for buffering and managing frame acknowledgments. 
I. 
Go-Back-N Protocol 
Working of Go-Back-N: 
a) Sliding Window Mechanism: 
o 
The sender can send multiple frames (up to a window size, NNN) without 
waiting for an acknowledgment for the ﬁrst frame. 
b) Frame Transmission: 
o 
Frames are sent consecutively, each with a sequence number starting from 0. 
c) Receiving Acknowledgments: 
o 
The receiver sends an ACK for the last correctly received frame. If a frame is lost 
or erroneous, the receiver discards that frame and all subsequent ones, only 
sending an ACK for the last correct one. 
d) Retransmission: 
o 
If a frame is not acknowledged, the sender retransmits that frame and all 
subsequent frames in the window. 
Illustration: 
 
Sender: Sends frames 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 
 
Receiver: Receives frames 0, 1, 2, but frame 3 is lost, sending an ACK for frame 2. 
 
Sender: Retransmits frames 3, 4 after a timeout. 
II. 
Selective Repeat ARQ Protocol 
Working of Selective Repeat ARQ: 
a) Sliding Window Mechanism: 

o 
Similar to Go-Back-N, but the sender can also send multiple frames without 
waiting for ACKs. 
b) Frame Transmission: 
o 
The sender transmits up to NNN frames. 
c) Receiving Acknowledgments: 
o 
The receiver acknowledges frames individually. If a frame is received out of order, 
it is buffered instead of discarded. 
d) Retransmission: 
o 
Only the speciﬁc lost frames are retransmitted, not the subsequent frames. 
Illustration: 
 
Sender: Sends frames 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 
 
Receiver: Receives frames 0, 1, 2, but frame 3 is lost, sending an ACK for frame 2. 
 
Sender: Only retransmits frame 3. 
12. Explain how the differences between IPv4 and IPv6 impact internet-connectivity and address management 
in practical scenarios? 
The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 represents a signiﬁcant evolution in internet connectivity and address 
management, primarily driven by the limitations of IPv4. Here’s an explanation of how the differences 
between IPv4 and IPv6 impact these areas in practical scenarios: 
1. Address Space 
IPv4: 
 
Format: Uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for about 4.3 billion unique addresses. 
 
Limitation: As the internet grew, the available IPv4 addresses became exhausted, leading to 
address scarcity and challenges in assigning addresses to new devices. 
IPv6: 
 
Format: Uses 128-bit addresses, which allows for approximately 3.4×10383.4 \times 
10^{38}3.4×1038 unique addresses. 
 
Impact: The vast address space of IPv6 alleviates address exhaustion issues, enabling every 
device to have a unique address. This is particularly important for the growing number of 
Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 
2. Address Management 
IPv4: 
 
Network Address Translation (NAT): Due to limited addresses, NAT is often used to allow 
multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address. This complicates 
network conﬁguration and management. 
 
Subnetting: Subnetting is necessary to manage address allocation efﬁciently, leading to 
complex routing and management overhead. 
IPv6: 

 
No NAT Required: The abundance of IPv6 addresses reduces the need for NAT, simplifying 
network architecture. Each device can have a globally unique address, enhancing end-to-end 
connectivity. 
 
Simpliﬁed Addressing: IPv6 allows for hierarchical addressing and routing, making it easier 
to manage large networks and allocate addresses in a more structured manner. 
3. Connectivity 
IPv4: 
 
Limited Mobility: IPv4 can struggle with mobile devices due to NAT and its reliance on ﬁxed 
IP addresses, making it challenging for devices to maintain connectivity when changing 
networks. 
 
Routing Table Size: As networks grow, IPv4 routing tables can become large and unwieldy, 
impacting routing efﬁciency and performance. 
IPv6: 
 
Improved Mobility: IPv6 supports better mobility features, allowing devices to move 
between networks while maintaining their IP addresses, thus ensuring consistent 
connectivity. 
 
Efﬁcient Routing: The hierarchical nature of IPv6 addresses leads to more efﬁcient routing, 
reducing the size of routing tables and improving overall network performance. 
4. Security Features 
IPv4: 
 
Optional Security: Security features like IPsec are optional in IPv4, meaning that not all 
implementations utilize them, potentially exposing data to security risks. 
IPv6: 
 
Built-in Security: IPv6 was designed with security in mind, incorporating IPsec as a fundamental 
component. This enhances the security of communications over the internet, making it more 
robust against attacks. 
5. Practical Scenarios 
 
IoT Expansion: As the IoT ecosystem expands, the need for a vast number of IP addresses 
becomes critical. IPv6’s address space allows for unique addressing for millions of devices, 
facilitating their integration into the internet. 
 
Cloud Computing: Organizations leveraging cloud services beneﬁt from IPv6’s ability to provide 
a unique address for each virtual machine, enhancing scalability and simplifying management. 
 
Home Networks: With more devices connecting to home networks (smart TVs, smartphones, 
smart appliances), IPv6 allows each device to connect with its own address without the 
complexities of NAT. 
 
Network Performance: For service providers, the efﬁcient routing enabled by IPv6 can lead to 
reduced latency and improved service quality, beneﬁting end-users.

the system (all station together) produces a 1000 frames per second B. 500 framesper seconds C. 250 
Frames per second 
 
 
14. Differentiate between packet switching and circuit switching. 
Circuit Switching 
Circuit switching is a method where a dedicated communication path or circuit is established between two 
endpoints for the duration of a communication session. This approach is traditionally used in voice 
communication systems, like the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). 

 
Connection Setup: A dedicated path must be established before data transmission can start. This setup 
time can introduce initial delays. 
 
Dedicated Path: Once the path is established, it remains dedicated to that session, meaning no other 
data can use the path until the session ends. 
 
Continuous Data Flow: Data flows in a continuous, predictable manner since the path is reserved 
exclusively for that connection. 
 
Fixed Bandwidth: Circuit switching provides fixed bandwidth for each connection, ensuring consistent 
quality of service (QoS). 
 
Examples: Traditional telephone networks, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). 
Advantages: 
 
Reliable and predictable performance due to dedicated paths. 
 
Ideal for real-time, continuous data transfer (e.g., voice and video). 
Disadvantages: 
 
Inefficient use of resources, as the dedicated path remains idle if no data is being sent. 
 
Connection setup time can introduce delays. 
 
Poor scalability for networks with high traffic, as each connection requires a separate path. 
       Packet Switching 
Packet switching is a method where data is divided into packets before being transmitted. Each packet is 
sent independently, potentially taking different routes to reach the destination. Packet switching is widely 
used in digital networks, including the internet. 
 
No Dedicated Path: Packets are routed individually based on the destination address in each packet, 
with no dedicated path required. 
 
Dynamic Routing: Each packet can take a different path to reach the destination, allowing for efficient 
use of network resources. 
 
Burst Transmission: Data is sent in bursts, with packets sent as they become available. 
 
Variable Bandwidth: The network dynamically allocates bandwidth, adjusting based on traffic and 
congestion. 
 
Examples: Internet Protocol (IP) networks, Ethernet, Voice over IP (VoIP). 
Advantages: 
 
Efficient use of network resources as bandwidth is shared among multiple users. 
 
High scalability due to flexible routing and resource allocation. 
 
Suitable for data that can tolerate slight delays, like emails or web browsing. 

Disadvantages: 
 
Potential for variable delays and packet loss due to network congestion. 
 
Not ideal for real-time applications without additional QoS measures. 
 
Packets may arrive out of order and need reassembly, requiring extra processing. 
15. What is the process of error detection and error correction in block coding? 
Error detection and correction in block coding is crucial for maintaining data integrity, especially in digital 
communication systems where errors can occur due to noise, signal degradation, or interference. Block coding 
achieves this by encoding the original data bits into longer sequences called "codewords," which include 
additional, carefully calculated bits known as redundant or parity bits. These extra bits enable the receiving 
system to detect errors, and in certain cases, correct them without needing to request a retransmission, thereby 
enhancing data reliability and transmission efficiency. 
Parity Checking 
Parity checking is one of the simplest methods of error detection. It works by adding a single extra bit, known as 
a parity bit, to each block of data. This parity bit is set in a way that the total number of 1's in the block becomes 
either even or odd. In even parity, the parity bit is chosen so that the sum of all 1’s in the codeword is even, 
whereas in odd parity, it is set to make the sum odd. If the data arrives at the destination with an incorrect parity, 
it indicates that an error has occurred during transmission. While parity checking is straightforward and useful 
for detecting single-bit errors, it has limitations. It cannot detect multiple errors that balance each other out (i.e., 
an even number of errors), nor can it pinpoint the exact location of the error, making it unsuitable for error 
correction. 
Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC) 
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is a more advanced method commonly used for error detection in network 
communications, such as LANs and WANs. CRC works by treating the data as a long binary number and 
performing polynomial division to generate a unique remainder called the frame check sequence. This sequence is 
appended to the data before transmission. Upon receiving the data, the receiver performs the same polynomial 
division. If the calculated remainder (or frame check sequence) matches the appended sequence, the data is 
considered error-free; otherwise, an error is detected. CRC is particularly effective at detecting burst errors (a 
series of consecutive errors) and is widely used due to its robustness. However, CRC alone does not provide error 
correction; it’s often used in systems that can request data retransmission if an error is detected. 
Hamming Codes 
Hamming codes offer both error detection and correction by adding multiple parity bits to each block of data. 
These parity bits are placed at specific positions in the codeword, creating a pattern that allows the receiver to 
identify the location of any single-bit error. For example, a (7,4) Hamming code encodes four data bits with three 
parity bits, creating a 7-bit codeword that can detect and correct any single-bit error. If an error is detected, the 
system calculates a value known as the "syndrome," which indicates the position of the error, enabling the 
receiver to flip the incorrect bit back to its original state. Hamming codes are particularly useful in scenarios 

where single-bit errors are expected, and retransmission is not feasible, such as in computer memory systems or 
satellite communications. 
Checksum Method 
The checksum method is widely used for detecting errors in data transmissions, particularly in packet-based 
systems. In this technique, data is divided into segments, and a mathematical sum (known as the checksum) is 
calculated by adding up the segments using 1’s complement arithmetic. This checksum is then transmitted 
alongside the data. Upon receiving the data, the receiver performs the same calculation and compares the 
checksum to the received checksum. If there’s a mismatch, an error is detected. The checksum method is 
relatively simple and effective for detecting errors caused by random noise. However, it may be less capable of 
detecting complex or systematic error patterns, like certain types of burst errors, so it is often used in systems 
where error patterns are relatively random.

21. Explain the different frame types in HDLC? 
Different Frame Types in HDLC 
High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) is a protocol used for data transmission across a network. It operates on the 
data link layer of the OSI model and provides reliable communication by managing frames, ensuring error detection, 
and supporting flow control. HDLC defines three distinct frame types: Information (I) frames, Supervisory (S) 
frames, and Unnumbered (U) frames. Each frame type serves a specific purpose to facilitate effective data 
communication. 
Information (I) frames are the most commonly used frames in HDLC and carry the actual user data from one 
network device to another. These frames are used for transmitting sequential data and carry sequence numbers that 
help ensure that the frames are received in order, enabling the protocol to detect and request retransmission of any 
missing frames. They also provide acknowledgment capabilities within the frame itself, allowing for efficient two-way 
communication. 
Supervisory (S) frames are used for flow control and error control, without carrying any actual user data. They 
support functions like acknowledgment (ACK), negative acknowledgment (NACK), and request for retransmission of 
frames. S frames help manage the status of the link by indicating if the receiver is ready to accept more data, has 
encountered an error, or if it is temporarily not ready to receive data. 
Unnumbered (U) frames serve a variety of control purposes and are used primarily for link management. Unlike I 
and S frames, U frames are not sequenced, making them ideal for initializing and managing the connection state. 
They are used to establish, terminate, and reset connections and can also convey commands such as "Set 
Asynchronous Balanced Mode" (SABM) to initiate the connection and "Disconnect" (DISC) to terminate it. U frames 
provide flexibility in controlling the link status and handling various control functions required for network 
management. 
Each frame type in HDLC plays a vital role in ensuring smooth data communication, allowing HDLC to offer reliable, 
orderly, and error-free data transfer across networks. 
22. Explain stop and wait automatic repeat request protocol? 
Stop-and-Wait Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Protocol 
The Stop-and-Wait Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocol is a simple and widely used error-control mechanism 
in data communication. It ensures reliable data transfer by allowing only one data frame to be transmitted at a time, 
and requiring the sender to wait for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver before sending the next frame. If 
the acknowledgment is not received within a specified timeout period, the sender assumes the frame was lost or 
corrupted and retransmits it. 
In this protocol, the process begins when the sender transmits a single data frame to the receiver. Once the receiver 
successfully receives and verifies the frame, it sends an acknowledgment back to the sender. Upon receiving the ACK, 
the sender is allowed to send the next frame in the sequence. This approach is straightforward but introduces a 

significant delay in cases where the round-trip time (RTT) is high, as the sender must wait for an acknowledgment 
after each frame. This waiting time can lead to inefficiencies, particularly in high-latency networks. 
Stop-and-Wait ARQ also employs a simple error-detection mechanism. If a frame is found to be corrupted on the 
receiver’s end (often detected using checksums), the receiver discards it and does not send an acknowledgment. This 
lack of acknowledgment prompts the sender to retransmit the frame once the timeout period elapses, ensuring that 
corrupted or lost frames are re-sent. However, if the acknowledgment itself is lost, the sender will retransmit the 
frame, potentially causing the receiver to receive the same frame twice. To prevent duplicate frames, sequence 
numbers (typically 0 and 1) are added to the frames, allowing the receiver to recognize and discard duplicates if 
necessary. 
The Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol is simple and effective for error detection and control, but it is not optimal for 
high-speed or long-distance networks, as it can lead to idle waiting times. Nonetheless, it forms the basis for more 
complex and efficient ARQ protocols used in modern data communication. 
23. With the suitable example explain the working of CDMA? 
Working of CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) 
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is a multiple-access method used in communication systems, enabling 
multiple users to share the same frequency spectrum simultaneously. Unlike other techniques like Frequency Division 
Multiple Access (FDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), where users are separated by frequency or 
time, CDMA assigns each user a unique code sequence. These unique codes allow multiple users to transmit 
simultaneously over the same frequency band, with each user’s signal distinguished by its code. 
In CDMA, each user is assigned a unique spreading code, also known as a pseudo-random noise (PN) code or 
spreading sequence. The data signal from each user is multiplied (spread) by this code, which increases the 
bandwidth of the original signal, spreading it across a wide frequency range. At the receiver’s end, the signal is 
multiplied by the same code to retrieve the original data. Because each user’s code is orthogonal (i.e., has low cross-
correlation) to others, the receiver can differentiate between signals even if multiple users transmit on the same 
frequency at the same time. This approach is highly resistant to interference and allows efficient use of available 
bandwidth. 

 
24. With the flow diagram explain the working of CSMA/CD? 
Working of CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) 
Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is a network protocol used in wired local area 
networks (LANs) to manage data transmission and prevent data collisions on a shared communication channel. 
This protocol is especially crucial in Ethernet networks, where multiple devices may attempt to transmit data 
simultaneously. CSMA/CD helps ensure that devices take turns in accessing the network and, if a collision 
occurs, efficiently handles retransmission. 
Steps in CSMA/CD Process with Flow Diagram Explanation 
In CSMA/CD, a device listens to the channel to determine if it’s free before transmitting data. If the channel is 
busy, the device waits until it becomes free. After detecting no active transmissions, it proceeds to transmit data. 
If two devices attempt to transmit at the same time, a collision occurs, which is detected by the devices, 
prompting them to stop transmitting and wait for a random time before attempting to retransmit. Below is an 
explanation of each step along with a flow diagram representation. 
Step 1: Carrier Sensing 
1. Listen to Channel: Before transmitting, each device listens to the network to check if the channel is idle. 
2. Channel Status Check: If the channel is busy (occupied by another device), the device waits until it 
becomes free. 
Step 2: Data Transmission 
1. Transmit Data: Once the device detects an idle channel, it begins transmitting data. 
Step 3: Collision Detection 

1. Detect Collision: If two devices transmit simultaneously, a collision occurs. Each device can detect this by 
monitoring the voltage or signal strength on the network. 
2. Stop Transmission: Upon detecting a collision, both devices immediately stop transmitting to avoid further 
interference. 
Step 4: Backoff Mechanism 
1. Random Wait: After detecting a collision, each device waits for a random period before retrying. This 
random delay helps reduce the likelihood of another collision when they attempt to retransmit. 
2. Retransmission: Once the random waiting time has elapsed, each device reattempts the transmission, 
starting with the channel sensing phase again. 
Step 5: Successful Transmission 
1. Transmission Success: If there is no collision during the transmission, the data is successfully transmitted to 
the destination. 
Flow Diagram for CSMA/CD 
Below is a simplified flow of how CSMA/CD operates: 
1. Start: The device checks if the channel is idle. 
2. Channel Free?: 
o 
If the channel is busy, the device waits and rechecks. 
o 
If the channel is free, it starts transmitting data. 
3. Collision Occurred? 
o 
If no collision occurs, the transmission is completed successfully. 
o 
If a collision occurs, both devices stop transmitting and enter the backoff phase. 
4. Backoff and Retransmit: After a random waiting period, the devices sense the channel again and attempt to 
retransmit. 
CSMA/CD efficiently controls access to the shared medium, minimizing collision impacts and maintaining 
smooth data flow in wired networks, making it a foundational protocol in Ethernet technology.

Working of Virtual Circuit in Computer Networks 
A virtual circuit is a method used in computer networks, especially in packet-switched networks, to create a 
logical connection between a source and a destination before data transmission. This logical path allows data 
packets to follow the same route across the network, which provides a more predictable and organized 

transmission process. Virtual circuits are often used in connection-oriented networks, such as Frame Relay, ATM 
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode), and MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching). 
The working of a virtual circuit involves three main stages: 
1. Connection Establishment: Before data transmission, a connection is established between the sender and 
receiver. The network assigns a unique virtual circuit identifier (VCI) for this connection, which remains 
consistent throughout the session. Routers along the path set up routing tables to recognize this VCI, 
ensuring that packets will follow the predetermined path. 
2. Data Transfer: Once the connection is established, data is transmitted in packets. Each packet includes the 
VCI, allowing routers to quickly forward the packets along the predefined path without needing to inspect 
the full IP address. This process reduces processing time and enhances data transfer speed. Since the 
packets follow the same path, they arrive in order, reducing the need for reassembly at the destination. 
3. Connection Termination: After data transmission is complete, the connection is terminated. The sender and 
receiver send messages to release the reserved resources and clear the routing tables. This step ensures that 
resources are freed up for other transmissions, maintaining network efficiency. 
Virtual circuits provide advantages such as predictable routing and ordered packet delivery. However, they can be 
less flexible than datagram (connectionless) networks, as they require initial setup time and resource reservation. 
 
 

 
26. Explain in detail the three controlled access methods? 
Controlled access methods are networking protocols that regulate how multiple devices share a 
communication channel, minimizing collisions by coordinating access. The three main controlled access 
methods are Reservation, Polling, and Token Passing. 
1. ReservaƟon Access Method 
In the reservation method, devices make reservations for a time slot before they can transmit data. The 
channel is divided into fixed time slots, and each device reserves a slot in advance, which helps prevent 
collisions by ensuring only one device transmits in a given slot. This method is widely used in centralized 
systems, like satellite communication networks. 
Pros: Reduces collision risk; efficient for time-sensitive applications. 
Cons: Can be inefficient if slots are unused; doesn’t scale well for large networks due to high reservation 
overhead. 
2. Polling Access Method 
In polling, a central controller (like a server or primary device) polls each device in a sequence, giving each 
one a chance to transmit. Devices can only send data when they are specifically polled. This approach 
ensures orderly access to the channel, often used in systems where a central controller can manage 
communication, such as point-of-sale (POS) systems. 
Pros: Ensures collision-free access; orderly communication. 
Cons: Adds overhead with polling messages; central controller failure disrupts network operation. 
3. Token Passing Access Method 
In token passing, a special packet known as a token circulates around the network. Only the device that 
holds the token is allowed to transmit data. After transmitting, the device passes the token to the next device 

in the sequence, creating a controlled access loop. This method is effective in networks with ring or bus 
topologies, like Token Ring and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) networks. 
Pros: Eliminates collisions, provides fair access to the channel. 
Cons: Token loss or duplication can disrupt the network; slower in larger networks due to token passing 
delay.

28. Explain 802.3 MAC frame format? 
The 802.3 MAC (Media Access Control) frame format is used in Ethernet networks to define how 
data is transmitted between devices on the network. It specifies the structure of the frame that 
encapsulates the data to be transmitted over the physical medium. Here’s a breakdown of the 802.3 
MAC frame format:
